Mario_Game complicated.....
Final Project idea = Ludo Game 

Project Discussion:
1) Work division:
    - Wajeeh with UML designing and video making
    - Wania and Mariyam prepare the script for the video
        -include the complications we had when thinking about the       implementation of the mario game
        - Why was Mario rejected = too many scripts(for mario and obstacles, enemies etc), working on a running screen and implement levels.
    - Wania/Mariyam also work on the document once UML is made
