Mario_Game complicated.....
Final Project idea = Ludo Game 

Project Discussion:
1) Work division:
    - Wajeeh with UML designing and video making
    - Wania and Marium prepare the script for the video
        -include the complications we had when thinking about the implementation of the mario game
        - Why was Mario rejected = too many scripts(for mario and obstacles, enemies etc), working on a running screen and implement levels.It was also very complicated to make since all of us are beginners.
    - Wania/Mariyam also work on the document once UML is made.
    (In the document, we will add the UML diagram and the description of the classes we plan to add in our project)
