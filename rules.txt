Basic Rules:
1) each player is said to have 4 tokens whose crown access level is set to be 0 and locked state == false.
2) For each player's token to be on the field or on the actual playable board, the player must get a 6 on his dice.
    - after a player draws a 6 on his dice, he can then add the token to the board and have the turn again. 
    - the set token's locked state is then set to false.
