Basic Rules:

1)Setup:
   - There will be a square board with four colored boxes.
   - Each player has four pieces(tokens) of a specific color.
   - Start in matching bases; goal is to move all pieces to the center home.

2)Gameplay:
   - 2 to 4 players take turns rolling a die.
   - Players move token based on the die roll.
   - Roll a six to start a token or move a token already present on the board.

3)Rules of Sixes:
   - Roll a six to start a token or move a token in play.
   -The player can take another turn after rolling the six.
   - Three consecutive sixes result in losing the turn.

4)Landing on Squares:
   - Land on opponent's place results the token to send it back to its base home.
   - Land on own piece to create a blocked space.

5)Winning:
   - Move all four tokens to the home base.
   - First player to complete all journeys wins.
   - Other players continue for runner-up positions.

Note:
-Each player is said to have 4 tokens whose crown access level is set to be 0 and locked state == false.(When a token completes one round and reaches the home area then the access level of the token is increased by 1)
-For each player's token to be on the field or on the actual playable board, the player must get a 6 on his dice.
    - after a player draws a 6 on his dice, he can then add the token to the board and have the turn again. 
    - the set token's locked state is then set to false.
